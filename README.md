1. Request a number from Client-side and server will calculate the Square of the number and
return it to client in response. Use TCP Protocol implementation.
2. Request a number from Client-side and server will calculate the Cube of the number and return
it to client in response. Use UDP Protocol implementation.
3. Enter a set of numeric values at client-side and send it to server-side. Server will fetch the
values and return all Prime numbers from the series received. If the set of values does not have
any prime number return 0. Use TCP Protocol implementation.
4. Enter a set of numeric values at client-side and send it to server-side. Server will fetch the
values and return all the three Quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3) for the set of values received. Use UDP
Protocol implementation.
5. Write a menu driven program to convert temperature entered in Celsius to Fahrenheit and
vice-versa. Also use one option for Exit. Use UDP Protocol. Consider the below given options:
a. Celsius to Fahrenheit
b. Fahrenheit to Celsius

6. Write a menu driven program to calculate the area of different shapes. Also use one option for
Exit. Take appropriate inputs from Client and use appropriate formulas for the same. Use TCP
protocol. Consider the below given shapes:
a. Circle
b. Square
c. Rectangle
d. Triangle

7. Enter a sentence at Client side and pass it to Server. Server should convert it into Camel Case
and return it to Client as response. Use TCP Protocol implementation.
 Example, Input: SLow and STEADY wiNs the RacE
 Output: Slow And Steady Wins The Race

8. Enter a sentence at Client side and pass it to Server. Server should convert it into Toggle Case
and return it to Client as response. Use UDP Protocol implementation.
 Example, Input: all that GLITTERS IS Not GolD
 Output: aLL tHAT gLITTERS iS nOT gOLD
